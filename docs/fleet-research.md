# Fleet Research Notes (v1)

This page supports the passenger fleet presentation in `fleet.html` and uses typical mission-fit guidance rather than guaranteed performance values.

## ERJ145 (configured 60 seats)

### Mission fit
- Group transport where seat volume is the priority.
- Corporate/event/team movements on fixed departure windows.
- Regional corridors where one aircraft needs to move many passengers.

### Practical strengths
- Better per-seat economics at higher load factors than light executive jets.
- Airliner-style cabin and baggage profile for larger parties.
- Good option for repeat shuttle-style scheduling.

### Operational tradeoffs
- Not optimized for VIP privacy compared with executive jet cabins.
- Less efficient than a small jet when passenger count is low.

- Business day returns and urgent leadership movements.

### Practical strengths
- Premium private-jet experience with small-party privacy.
- Faster dispatch and lower boarding complexity for executive groups.
- Strong fit for short-notice itineraries.

### Operational tradeoffs
